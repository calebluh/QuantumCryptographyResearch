 Notebook for Quantum Cryptography answering the question "How does increasing depolarizing noise in a quantum channel affect the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and the length of the secure key generated by the BB84 protocol when simulated using Qiskit?"

The first two sections of code are working, and I am actively trying to make the third section with noise automate the steps so I can compare and graph the QBER based on different p_depol values.
