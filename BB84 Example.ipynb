    "\n",
    "### Noise Components\n",
    "- **Depolarizing Noise:** A type of noise that randomly flips a qubit's state (with some probability), making it less correlated with the original state. A common model for errors in quantum channels.\n",
    "- **Noise Model:** A representation of the errors that occur on a real or simulated quantum device or channel. Used by the simulator to mimic non-ideal behavior.\n",
    "- **p_depol:** The parameter representing the probability of depolarization occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Elements\n",
    "- **depolarizing_error:** A specific function in Qiskit Aer's noise module to create a depolarizing error object.\n",
    "- **add_all_qubit_quantum_error:** A method to add a specific error type to the noise model, applying it to certain gates or all qubits when those gates are used.\n",
    "- **Identity Gate (id):** A quantum gate that does nothing to the qubit's state. Used in this simulation as a placeholder where the noise model applies the depolarizing error, representing the noisy quantum channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Metrics\n",
    "- **QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate):** The percentage or fraction of bits that are different between Alice's and Bob's raw keys in the rounds where their bases matched. A key indicator of noise or eavesdropping.\n",
    "- **Errors:** The count of bits that differ between Alice's and Bob's raw keys after sifting.\n",
    "- **Sifted Bits Count:** The total number of bits in the raw key after sifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement Statistics\n",
    "- **Qubit Counts:** Data structure used in the code to aggregate the measurement outcomes for each individual qubit across all simulation shots.\n",
    "- **Most Frequent Outcome:** The measurement outcome (0 or 1) that occurred most often for a specific qubit across all simulation shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Analysis\n",
    "- **Secure Key Rate (Asymptotic):** A theoretical formula that estimates the number of secure bits that can be distilled per sifted bit, based on the QBER. Applies in the limit of sending a very large number of qubits.\n",
    "- **Binary Entropy Function (h(x)):** A mathematical function used in the secure key rate formula to quantify the uncertainty associated with a probability.\n",
    "- **Estimated Secure Key Length:** The calculated length of the final secure key based on the estimated secure key rate and the number of sifted bits.\n",
    "- **QBER Threshold:** The maximum QBER (approximately 11% for BB84) above which it is generally not possible to distill a secure key."
